# Shopify App Analysis
The Shopify App Analysis project involved utilizing Power BI to explore the Shopify dataset and uncover insights into the app landscape, reviews, and app reviews. Specific visualizations were created to identify trends within each category, providing actionable insights for business decision-making. Due to limitations in grading Power BI files, screenshots of the visualizations were submitted for evaluation.
