This project investigated the user journey on a platform, analyzing how user activity translated into sales. The objective was to identify areas for improvement in user conversion and retention.

A conversion funnel was constructed using "raw_user_activity" data to track how product views converted into purchases. Pivot tables and calculated fields were used to measure conversion rates. Cohort analysis was conducted to isolate purchase events, identify first purchase dates, and group users by acquisition month. Retention rates were calculated for each cohort based on unique user activity over time. The findings were presented in a well-organized and visually appealing spreadsheet.

Analysis revealed that the first user cohort exhibited the highest retention rate, with a significant drop between months two and three.

The project recommends prioritizing marketing efforts to target newer user cohorts to improve their retention on the platform.
