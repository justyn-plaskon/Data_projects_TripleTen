### Description:
Included is the 4 page .pdf final report based off the given data. 


### Findings:
The project analyzed user data from the past five years to identify listening trends. It was found that electronic and hip-hop genres were rapidly gaining popularity among users. Rock was the most popular genre among free users. 

### Recommendations:
To increase user engagement and attract new users, it is recommended to offer artists in these genres limited-time promotional deals. Additionally, given that rock was the most popular genre among free users, promoting the paid service with a free trial to this user segment is suggested. For paid users, where indie music was most popular, it is recommended to focus referral programs and ad campaigns on this group.
