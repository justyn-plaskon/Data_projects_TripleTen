# Cause of Returns at Superstore
The project leveraged the Superstore dataset to analyze return rates. A calculated field was implemented to isolate returned orders, facilitating subsequent analysis. Tableau visualizations were employed to identify return patterns across various dimensions. Key findings include a disproportionately high return rate for the tables product category, significantly impacting profitability. Binders were found to be the most returned sub-Category although impacting profitability less severly. A Dashboard and story presentation were created to explain findings to stakeholders.
