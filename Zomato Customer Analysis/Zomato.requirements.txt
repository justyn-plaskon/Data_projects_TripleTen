Participants assumed the role of junior analysts tasked with conducting a rigorous analysis of Zomato's customer and restaurant datasets. 
The project demanded a comprehensive exploration of customer segmentation, a deep dive into restaurant performance metrics, and a holistic assessment of overall business performance. 
A project plan outlining the analytical approach taken was delivered before the final presentation. 
An interactive dashboard that effectively visualizes key findings and insights was delivered. 
Finally, a detailed report summarizing the analysis process, key discoveries, and actionable recommendations is essential.
