# Conversion Funnel Event Analysis

This project analyzed user behavior to understand the conversion and retention rates on a platform. By constructing a conversion funnel and conducting cohort analysis, the project identified a significant decline in user retention after the initial month. To address this, the project recommends focusing marketing efforts on newer user cohorts to improve overall platform retention.
