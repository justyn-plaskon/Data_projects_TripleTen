This project aimed to analyze spending trends within the Zomato customer base. By leveraging the Zomato dataset, the goal was to create actionable insights for management to optimize marketing strategies and customer retention.

The project involved data cleaning, merging relevant datasets, and generating visualizations that showcased spending patterns. Educational background, occupation, age, and marital status were used to segment customers. Tableau dashboards and stories were created to present findings and recommendations.

The project resulted in a user-friendly dashboard that revealed significant spending trends. Notably, single students were identified as the largest customer base. Additionally, a decline in spending with age was observed.

The project recommends focusing marketing efforts on retaining existing customers as they age and exploring targeted campaigns to attract older demographics. Additionally, capitalizing on the established single-student customer base can further enhance sales.
