The project involved analyzing product returns using Tableau to identify root causes. A calculated field was created to differentiate returned orders, enabling the calculation of return rates. Various analytical views were developed, including scatterplots to examine the correlation between total sales and returns, bar charts to display return rates by product category, and geographic and temporal analyses to identify patterns. Insights were compiled into a dashboard, beginning with low-fidelity mock-ups and culminating in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Finally, a Tableau Story was developed and presented, summarizing key findings and recommending strategies to reduce returns and enhance business performance.
