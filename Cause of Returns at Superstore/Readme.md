This project aimed to leverage Tableau to analyze product returns within the Superstore dataset and identify their root causes. The objective was to minimize return rates and improve business performance.

The project utilized the Superstore dataset, a sample dataset commonly used for data analysis practice. A calculated field was created to differentiate returned orders, enabling the calculation of return rates. Tableau visualizations were developed, including scatterplots, bar charts, and geographic/temporal analyses to identify patterns in return data. Insights were compiled into a user-friendly and interactive Tableau dashboard and story.

The project identified tables as a product category within the Superstore dataset with a high return rate, negatively impacting profitability. Additionally, binders within the table category were found to be the most frequently returned item.

The project recommends further investigation into the reasons behind high table returns within the Superstore dataset. Potentially, conducting customer surveys or focus groups could provide valuable insights. Additionally, exploring "special order" options for tables or increased customer interaction with salespeople before purchase can potentially minimize return rates for this specific product category.
