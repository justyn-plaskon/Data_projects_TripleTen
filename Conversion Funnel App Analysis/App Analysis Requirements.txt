To analyze product returns using the Shopify dataset, a conversion funnel was built using the "raw_user_activity" data to track how product page views converted into purchases. Pivot tables and calculated fields were used to measure conversion rates. Data for cohort analysis was prepared by isolating purchase events, calculating first purchase dates, and grouping users by month. Retention rates were calculated by grouping data into cohorts based on purchase month and tracking unique users over time. The analysis was organized into a polished spreadsheet, with clear summaries and formatted results for executive review.
